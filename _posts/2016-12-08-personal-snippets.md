For a while already I have discovered that sometimes I need to repeat some simple actions which at the first time required me some digging. So in order to avoid this kind of situations I've started to note down those actions with a short title. First that was a list in [worklowy](https://workflowy.com/) but this started to grow enormously so I've decided to migrate them to [gist](https://gist.github.com/kubagruszka/cfde41262c6e40e23e797bf74e2655dc)
